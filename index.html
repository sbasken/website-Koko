    <span class="byline">RIU DUNAMAR</span>
      <p>We stayed at <strong>Riu Dunamar</strong> from 12/24-12/30/22 to celebrate Christmas. <br>Located just 50 mins away from the airport, it was a <em>bautiful, family-friendly, all inclusive,</em> hotel resort right on the ocean in Cancun.<br> We have two young children, aged 7 and 9, so being an all-inclusive & family-friendly was a huge plus. <br>In-laws met us there and we had a great time over the holiday season.</p>

      <span class="byline">Chichen Itza</span>
      <p>While we were in Mexico, we spent most of our time in the pool at the resort. <br>However, it was unfortunately raining for the first few days of our stay, which we were told very unusual in December for the region, we took a day tour to see the beautiful <strong>Chichen Itza</strong>! <br>(My kids, and yes my husband too, kept calling it "Chicken Pizza")<br> We got this great tour deal at the airport, right after we left the baggage claim with a travel agent. <br> It was US$50 per adult and kids go free, and it was a <u>whole day trip</u>; <em> transportation, meals, tickets, all included</em>!!<br> Chichen Itza was absolutely gorgeous. <br>Although the bus ride was rather long, the kids enjoyed seeing the beautiful Mayan pyramid. <br>The youndest got to see one of the World Wonders at the age of mere 7! <br>Isn't that amazing??</p>

    <h2 id="food">*** Food and Drinks ***</h2>
      <span class="byline">Cocktails and Soft Drinks</span>
      <p>Food and drinks were amazing too! <br>At the hotel, it was mostly all you can eat/drink but you could also get a table at one of the 5 restaurants as part of the all inclusive deal.<br> We tried all except for the fancy one but they were all better than we expected. <br>If you or your kiddos aren't as adventurous as we are when it comes to food, rest assured, they had plenty of burgers, fries, and pizzas<br><br> I kept drinking <em>pina colada</em> for most of the time but they can make <em>virgin</em> version of any drink for kids so in the last day or two, our kids enjoyed drinking <em>Banana Mama</em>, a drink that I believe has bananas and strawberries and they loved it!</p>
