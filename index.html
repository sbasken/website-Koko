    <h1>Hello Mexico!</h1>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    <h2>Hotel</h2>
    <p>We stayed at <strong>Riu Dunamar</strong> from 12/24-12/30/22 to celebrate Christmas. Located just 50 mins away from the airport, it was a <em>bautiful, family-friendly, all inclusive,</em> hotel resort right on the ocean in Cancun. We have two young children, aged 7 and 9, so being an all-inclusive & family-friendly was a huge plus. In-laws met us there and we had a great time over the holiday season.</p>
    <h2>Places We Visited</h2>
    <p>While we were in Mexico, we spent most of our time in the pool at the resort. However, it was unfortunately raining for the first few days of our stay, which we were told very unusual in December for the region, we took a day tour to see the beautiful <strong>Chechen Itza</strong>!We got this tour deal at the airport, right after we left the baggage claim with a travel agent. <br> It was US$50 per adult and kids go free, and it was a <u>whole day trip</u>, <em> transportation, meals, tickets, included</em>!!<br> Chechen Itza was absolutely gorgeous. Although the bus ride was rather long, the kids enjoyed seeing the beautiful Mayan pyramid. The youndest got to see one of the World Wonders at the age of mere 7! Isn't that amazing??</p>
    <h2>Food and Drinks</h2>
    <p>Food and drinks were amazing too! At the hotel, it was mostly all you can eat/drink but you could also get a table at one of the 5 restaurants as part of the all inclusive deal. We tried all except for the fancy one but they were all better than we expected. If you or your kiddos aren't as adventurous as we are when it comes to food, rest assured, they had plenty of burgers, fries, and pizzas<br><br> I kept drinking <em>pina colada</em> for most of the time but they can make <em>virgin</em> version of any drink for kids so in the last day or two, our kids enjoyed drinking <em>Banana Mama</em>, a drink that I believe has bananas and strawberries and they loved it!</p>
